# Google translate api usage
This app takes a long text from any language, parses it with "space" characters and turns it into translatable pieces.
If you click on the higlighted word, it will translate it into english (this can be changed) and write it into the textfield above.
You must change projectid for your own project.
You need to get the credentials json from your google cloud console. Create a project there and enable translation api and create a service credential.
